/**
 * Signals that the caller supplied a value the API cannot accept.

 * <p>This exists to separate "the caller got it wrong" from "the application got it wrong". Both
 * used to surface as {@link IllegalArgumentException}, which the API mapped to 400 with the
 * exception's own text, so an internal invariant breaking anywhere below the controller was
 * reported to the caller as their mistake, with an internal message attached. Only this exception
 * is answered with 400, and only its message is safe to return: it is written for the caller.
 *
 * <p>Throw it for validation of request input. Leave {@link IllegalArgumentException} for broken
 * internal expectations, which belong in a 500 and in the logs.
